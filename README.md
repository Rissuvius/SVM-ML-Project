# SVM-ML-Project
Final project for my Machine Learning class where I make an SVM in R to classify users based on accelerometer data. I worked on this in the R terminal so I don't have a saved script of all the commands I ran, so I uploaded a PDF of the paper I submitted which includes many code snippets.
