# SVM-ML-Project
Final project for my Machine Learning class where I make an SVM in R to classify users based on accelerometer data. I worked on this in the R terminal so I don't have a saved script of all the commands I ran, so I uploaded a PDF of the paper I submitted which includes many code snippets. The paper had to justify the project in as it would be used in the real world which is why the paper includes minor parts on how the technology can be used.
